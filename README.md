# Welcome
The purpose of this Github page is to demonstrate my existing Project Management skillset and experience, accumilated throughout my journey as a Business Developer.  

As I am currently looking to transition into junior PM roles, I hope this page can serve as evidence of my dedication, passion and commitment to the task.  

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to encourage anyone reading this to feel free to reach me via any of the following  
email: aleks.kovalishin@gmail.com or linkedin: linkedin.com/in/kovalex/  
I am always eager for a chat, be it work-related or otherwise. The world does not stop on Github.com
