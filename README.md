# Welcome
The purpose of this GitHub page is to demonstrate my existing Project Management skillset and experience, accumilated throughout my journey as a Business Developer.  

As I am currently looking to transition into junior PM roles, I hope this page can serve as evidence of my dedication, passion and commitment to the task.
